# stage-chapters

Generates a Stage chapter run for the current local git branch and serves it at a browser review URL. Uses `stagereview prep` to compute the diff, then generates chapters and a prologue, and hands the result to `stagereview show` to launch the SPA.

## Prerequisites

Run these checks before any other work. If either fails, stop with the error message — do not continue.

1. **`stagereview` is installed.** Run `which stagereview`. If it exits non-zero, instruct the user:

   ```
   stagereview is not installed. Run:

       npm install -g stagereview

   Then retry /stage-chapters.
   ```

   Stop.

2. **The current directory is a git repo.** Run `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`. If it does not print `true`, stop with:

   ```
   /stage-chapters must be run inside a git repository.
   ```

## Step 1 — Run prep

```bash
PREP_FILE=$(stagereview prep)
```

`stagereview prep` auto-detects the base ref (main/master), computes the merge-base, generates the diff, filters out lockfiles/binaries, and formats hunks with line numbers for analysis. By default it auto-detects the diff scope: if uncommitted changes are present the diff includes staged, unstaged, and untracked files; otherwise it uses the committed branch diff. It writes a plain-text file and prints only the file path to stdout.

`prep` and `show` also accept positional git refs:

```bash
PREP_FILE=$(stagereview prep main)
PREP_FILE=$(stagereview prep main feature)
PREP_FILE=$(stagereview prep main..feature)
PREP_FILE=$(stagereview prep main...feature)
```

Use the same positional refs for `show`:

```bash
stagereview show "$AGENT_OUTPUT" main..feature
```

Both `prep` and `show` accept these optional flags:

- **`--base <ref>`** — base ref to diff against (default: auto-detect main/master).
- **`--compare <ref>`** — compare ref to diff against `--base`.
- **`--ref <mode>`** — diff scope. One of:
  - `work` — staged + unstaged + untracked changes (full working tree vs merge-base).
  - `staged` — only staged changes (index vs HEAD).
  - `unstaged` — only unstaged changes (working tree vs index).
  - Omitted — auto-detect (equivalent to `work` when uncommitted changes exist, committed branch diff otherwise).

When flags or positional refs are specified, pass the same scope to **both** `prep` and `show`:

```bash
PREP_FILE=$(stagereview prep --base feature-a --ref staged)
# ... later ...
stagereview show --base feature-a --ref staged "$AGENT_OUTPUT"

PREP_FILE=$(stagereview prep --base main --compare feature)
# ... later ...
stagereview show --base main --compare feature "$AGENT_OUTPUT"
```

If `prep` exits non-zero, relay its stderr to the user and stop.

**Do not modify files in the working tree between running `prep` and running `show`.** Both commands independently snapshot the git state. If the diff changes between them, `show` will reject the chapters with a hunk coverage error because the hunks no longer match.

## Step 2 — Read prep output

Read `$PREP_FILE` via the Read tool (or equivalent). For large diffs, use the Read tool's `offset` and `limit` parameters to read in chunks.

The file has two sections separated by headers:

1. **`=== COMMIT MESSAGES ===`** — `git log --oneline` output for prologue context.
2. **`=== HUNKS ===`** — formatted diff hunks with line numbers. Each hunk looks like:

```
=== File: src/app.ts (modified) | filePath: "src/app.ts", oldStart: 1 ===
=== Hunk @1: @@ -1,5 +1,6 @@ ===
1 1 | const a = 1;
2   |-const b = 2;
  2 |+const b = 3;
  3 |+const c = 4;
3 4 | const d = 5;
```

The two number columns are the **old line number** (left) and **new line number** (right). A blank column means the line doesn't exist on that side — additions have no old line number, deletions have no new line number. These numbers are used directly for `lineRefs` in key changes (see Step 3d).

`commits.txt` contains `git log --oneline` output for prologue context.

## Step 3 — Cluster + narrate

Using the hunks from `hunks.txt`, produce a `chapters` array. Each chapter groups related hunks into a coherent story beat, narrates them for a reviewer unfamiliar with this part of the codebase, and flags judgment calls that need human input.

### 3a — Clustering rules

Group hunks by **causal relationship** — changes that set up or enable later changes belong together.

- Spanning multiple files is expected and correct (e.g., schema + API + UI for one feature = one chapter).
- Moves and refactors are a single chapter — when code is removed from one file and added to another (or a file is deleted and a similar one created), group the deletion and addition hunks together as one "Move/Refactor" chapter, not separate "Remove" and "Add" chapters.
- Split only when changes are truly independent — a reviewer could understand one without knowing about the other.
- Tests belong with their implementation chapter.
- Config/dependency changes can be their own chapter if unrelated to a feature chapter.

**Chapter ordering:**

1. Foundation first: types, interfaces, schemas, utilities that others depend on
2. Core logic next: main implementation
3. Integration last: wiring, configuration, tests

Consider symbol dependencies between chapters — a chapter that introduces a type another chapter uses must come first.

**Hunk ordering within a chapter:**

- Group all hunks from the same file together — do not interleave hunks from different files.
- Within the same file, list hunks in ascending `oldStart` order (matching file layout).

### 3b — Self-validation rules

Every hunk in the formatted diff **must** appear in exactly one chapter. No hunk may be omitted and no hunk may appear in more than one chapter.

Each hunk header in the prep output has the format:
```
=== File: <path> (<status>) | filePath: "<path>", oldStart: <N> ===
```

Use the `filePath` and `oldStart` values from these headers to build `hunkRefs`.

`stagereview show` validates hunk coverage automatically — it will error with a list of missing or extra hunks if the chapters don't account for every hunk in the diff. If this happens, fix the chapters and retry.

### 3c — Narration rules

Write each chapter as a story beat — a meaningful step that moves the branch forward, not a summary of files changed.

- **Title:** action-oriented verb phrase, max 8 words (e.g., "Wire org ID through the API layer"). No filler like "Add support for".
- **Summary:** 2–3 sentences covering what this chapter enables and why. Lead with impact, then connect to the broader purpose. When a chapter builds on a previous one, open with that causal link explicitly (e.g., "Now that X is in place…").
  - Keep paragraphs short. Prefer splitting distinct points into separate short paragraphs (separated by a blank line) rather than writing one long dense paragraph. Each paragraph should convey a single idea.
  - Markdown allowed: `**bold**` for emphasis, `*italics*` for nuance, `` `backticks` `` for inline code references, and fenced code blocks when a short snippet (≤ 6 lines) helps illustrate the change.

### 3d — Key change rules

Key changes are **judgment calls only a human reviewer can make** — things that require product context, team conventions, or knowledge of the author's intent. Linters, type checkers, and code-review bots already cover correctness and style; skip anything they can catch. Ignore auto-generated files.

Return an **empty array** when nothing needs human input — do **not** invent items to fill the list. When a chapter is a straightforward rename, type fix, or mechanical refactor with no judgment calls, `keyChanges` should be `[]`.

Frame each item as a **question**.

Each key change includes `lineRefs`: one line range per distinct spot the question depends on. Most questions touch a single location, so use one range; only add more when the judgment genuinely spans related code in different places.

**Reading line numbers from `hunks.txt`:** Each diff line shows two number columns — old (left) and new (right). Use these numbers directly:
- For `side: "deletions"` — use the **old** (left) column number as `startLine`/`endLine`.
- For `side: "additions"` — use the **new** (right) column number as `startLine`/`endLine`.
- Do **not** count lines yourself — read the numbers from the formatted output.

Keep ranges tight — point to the specific lines the question is about, not the entire hunk. `startLine` and `endLine` must both be positive integers with `endLine >= startLine`.

**Good examples:**

- "Should `retryCount` reset when the user switches orgs?"
- "Is a 60-minute session timeout appropriate for this user base, or would 30 minutes be safer?"
- "Does this new index cover the query patterns the team actually uses in production?"

**Bad examples:**

- "Check that the auth logic is correct." — vague, verifiable by reading the code
- "The function now handles errors." — changelog item, not a question
- "Make sure the tests pass." — CI catches this, not a human judgment call

### 3e — Output format

Produce an array of chapter objects. Each chapter:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "chapter-1",    // unique within the run, e.g. "chapter-1", "chapter-2", …
  "order": 1,           // positive integer, 1-indexed
  "title": "Short imperative title",
  "summary": "Why this chapter matters to the reviewer.",
  "hunkRefs": [
    // one entry per hunk in the chapter
    { "filePath": "path/to/file.ts", "oldStart": 42 }
  ],
  "keyChanges": [
    // zero or more judgment-call questions
    {
      "content": "A judgment-call question for the reviewer.",
      "lineRefs": [
        {
          "filePath": "path/to/file.ts",
          "side": "additions",
          "startLine": 50,
          "endLine": 55
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- Do **not** invent `hunkRefs` — only use `(filePath, oldStart)` tuples that actually appear in the formatted hunks.
- `keyChanges[].lineRefs` must have at least one entry per key change.

## Step 4 — Generate prologue

After building the chapters, generate a **prologue** — a high-level overview of the entire change. The prologue helps reviewers orient themselves before diving into individual chapters.

Use `commits.txt` from the prep output for context.

Using the diff, chapters, and commit messages, produce a `prologue` object with the following fields:

### motivation (string or null)

One sentence a non-engineer would understand. What was broken, annoying, or missing — from a person's perspective. If the commit messages are generic and the diff doesn't make the motivation obvious, use `null`.

**Good:** "Dashboards would break during deploys, so people had to keep refreshing until things came back."
**Bad:** "The API client had no retry logic for 503 errors." (too technical — no one outside the team knows what that means)

### outcome (string or null)

One sentence a non-engineer would understand. What's better now. Same null rule as motivation.

**Good:** "Dashboards stay up during deploys now."
**Bad:** "Added exponential backoff with a base delay of 100ms." (implementation detail)

### keyChanges (array of 2–5 objects)

Each object has:
- `summary`: 6–10 words describing what's different now. **Outcome-focused**, not action-focused.
- `description`: Capitalized sentence, 10–15 words of additional context.

**Good:** `summary: "Audit runs are now tracked in a database"`, `description: "Uses new Drizzle ORM schema with full history retention"`
**Bad:** `summary: "Adds Drizzle ORM layer"` (action-focused — describe what changed, not what you did)

### focusAreas (array of 1–5 objects)

Always provide at least 1 focus area. Even clean changes have spots worth a reviewer's attention.

Each object has:
- `type`: one of `security`, `breaking-change`, `high-complexity`, `data-integrity`, `new-pattern`, `architecture`, `performance`, `testing-gap`
- `severity`: one of `critical`, `high`, `medium` (for problems) or `info` (for points of interest)
- `title`: 3–5 word noun phrase (e.g., "Unvalidated user input")
- `description`: WHY this was flagged + a declarative action for the reviewer. Use "confirm", "verify", or "check" to give the reviewer a specific task.
- `locations`: array of file paths where this applies

**Good:** `type: "security", severity: "high", title: "Unvalidated user input", description: "User-provided ID passed directly to database query — confirm input is validated and parameterized"`
**Bad:** `description: "Worth understanding"` (no action, vague)

### complexity

Object with:
- `level`: one of `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very-high`
- `reasoning`: brief explanation (e.g., "New DB schema plus multiple service changes")

### Style

Talk like a coworker, not a changelog. No jargon, no filler phrases, no "this change introduces/implements/adds". Just say what happened and why it matters.

## Step 5 — Write agent output

Compute a unique temp path and write the JSON via a bash heredoc:

```bash
AGENT_OUTPUT=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/stage-agent-output.XXXXXX")
cat > "$AGENT_OUTPUT" << 'AGENT_EOF'
{
  "chapters": [ ... ],
  "prologue": { ... }
}
AGENT_EOF
```

The trailing `XXXXXX` (with no suffix after) is required by macOS BSD `mktemp`. Using `cat` with a heredoc avoids tool-specific file-writing issues.

Field rules:

| Field | Constraint |
|-------|------------|
| `chapters[].id` | Non-empty, unique within the run |
| `chapters[].order` | Positive integer (1-indexed) |
| `chapters[].hunkRefs[].oldStart` | Non-negative integer — the pre-image start line from the `oldStart` in the formatted hunk header (`0` for new files) |
| `chapters[].keyChanges[].lineRefs` | Array with at least one entry |
| `lineRefs[].side` | `"additions"` (right side) or `"deletions"` (left side) |
| `lineRefs[].startLine` / `endLine` | Positive integers; `endLine >= startLine` |
| `prologue` | Optional object; omit entirely if not desired |
| `prologue.motivation` | String or `null` |
| `prologue.outcome` | String or `null` |
| `prologue.keyChanges` | Array of 2–5 objects with `summary` and `description` |
| `prologue.focusAreas` | Array of 1–5 objects |
| `prologue.focusAreas[].type` | One of: `security`, `breaking-change`, `high-complexity`, `data-integrity`, `new-pattern`, `architecture`, `performance`, `testing-gap` |
| `prologue.focusAreas[].severity` | One of: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `info` |
| `prologue.complexity.level` | One of: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very-high` |

## Step 6 — Display generated chapters

Hand the file to `stagereview`:

```bash
stagereview show "$AGENT_OUTPUT"
```

`stagereview show` auto-detects the agent output format, independently computes the scope and "Other changes" chapter for filtered files, validates the JSON, inserts the run into the local SQLite database, boots a loopback HTTP server, and prints a review URL. Relay that URL to the user so they can open it when ready.

The browser UI lets the user leave draft feedback comments on files and diff lines. The comments are not delivered to you until the user presses **Submit feedback**.

**The command blocks until the user submits feedback or presses Ctrl+C.** If feedback is submitted, `stagereview show` writes a line to stdout:

```text
STAGE_FEEDBACK_SUBMITTED {"id":"...","runId":"...","submittedAt":"...","comments":[...]}
```

It also appends the same JSON object to the feedback file path printed near startup. After receiving `STAGE_FEEDBACK_SUBMITTED`, treat the submitted comments as the next user request: inspect the referenced files/lines, make the requested code changes, and verify them normally. If the user exits with Ctrl+C instead, stop without making follow-up changes.
